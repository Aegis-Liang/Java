1. Test 10: check that data type is immutable by testing whether each method
            returns the same value, regardless of any intervening operations
     * input8.txt
       - failed after 27 operations involving BruteCollinearPoints
       - first and last call to segments() returned different arrays

       - failed on trial 1 of 100

     * equidistant.txt
       - failed after 9 operations involving BruteCollinearPoints
       - first and last call to segments() returned different arrays

       - sequence of operations was:
             BruteCollinearPoints collinear = new BruteCollinearPoints(points);
             collinear.numberOfSegments() -> 4
             mutate points[] array that was passed to constructor
             mutate points[] array that was passed to constructor
             collinear.numberOfSegments() -> 4
             collinear.segments()
             collinear.numberOfSegments() -> 4
             mutate array returned by last call to segments()
             collinear.segments()

       - failed on trial 1 of 100

   ==> FAILED

   Because the linkedlist is empty when the segment function is call in the second or more time.
   Developer always make this bug and hard to knowing this.

      public LineSegment[] segments()
       {
           LineSegment[] result = new LineSegment[this.numLineSegments];
           for(int i=0; i<this.numLineSegments;i++)
               result[i] = this.llistLineSegment.pop();
           return result;
       }

    Because the segment function returns a reference not a value, its data type is mutable.

    public LineSegment[] segments()
    {
        return this.lineSegments;
    }
