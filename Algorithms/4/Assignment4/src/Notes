    {
        Board board2 = new Board(this.tiles);

        if(board2.tiles[0][0]==0 || board2.tiles[0][1]==0)
            this.swapTiles(board2, 1, 0, 1, 1);
        else
            this.swapTiles(board2, 0, 0, 0, 1);

      The causation of this question is hard to find if you are having it.
      The reason is when you compare the predecessor and its neighbors, you probably compare itself to its neighbors,
      and this equals will never be true and a lot of node is add into pq.

      After modify this, the score is changed from 66 to 95 ^_^!

      int moveNeighbor = snCurrent.move+1;
      for (Board boardNeighbor : snCurrent.board.neighbors() )
          {
              if(!snCurrent.board.equals(boardNeighbor))
                  pq.insert(new SearchNode(boardNeighbor, moveNeighbor, snCurrent));
          }

          change to

      int moveNeighbor = snCurrent.move+1;
      for (Board boardNeighbor : snCurrent.board.neighbors() )
          {
              if(snCurrent.predecessor == null || !snCurrent.predecessor.board.equals(boardNeighbor))
                  pq.insert(new SearchNode(boardNeighbor, moveNeighbor, snCurrent));
          }

   Just record that the checklist has something about cache and look for it, found:

   Cache either the Manhattan distance of a board (or Manhattan priority of a search node).
   It is waste to recompute the same quantity over and over again.

   After think about it, the compareTo() function is called many times, it's worthy to pre-calculate it.
   The priority and manhattan are added for fixing this issue.

       private class SearchNode implements Comparable<SearchNode>
       {
           private Board board;
           private int move;
           private SearchNode predecessor;
           private int priority;
           private int manhattan;
       }

4. Is the isGoal of Board class could be optimize? Initial a Goal board and compare it, it will save time to check
   the hamming every time, or store the hamming for caching.

5. Use a parity argument to determine whether a puzzle is unsolvable (instead of two synchronous A* searches).
   Later it's better to get understand the parity check for whether a board is unsolvable.

6. How can I reduce the amount of memory a Board uses? For starters, recall that an n-by-n int[][] array in Java uses about 24 + 32n + 4n^2 bytes;
   when n equals 3, this is 156 bytes. To save memory, consider using an n-by-n char[][] array or a length n^2 char[] array.
   You could use a more elaborate representation: since each board is a permutation of length n^2,
   in principle, you need only about lg ((n^2)!) bits to represent it; when n equals 3, this is only 19 bits.

   Consider how to store n = equals 3 in 19 bits.

7. Equals() implementation should be like following, this is talked about in

    public boolean equals(Object y)        // does this board equal y?
    {
        if (this == y) return true;
        if (y == null) return false;
        if (y.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;

        Board board2 = (Board) y;
        if (this.n != board2.n)
            return false;

        for (int r = 0; r < this.n; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < this.n; c++) {
                if (this.tiles[r][c] != board2.tiles[r][c])
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
